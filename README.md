# ðŸ“Š Linear Regression from Scratch (Gradient Descent + Visualizations)

This project implements **Linear Regression** from scratch using **Gradient Descent**.  
It also provides rich **visualizations** of the training process, cost function contours, and an animation of how the regression line improves over time.

## âœ¨ Features
- Implemented without scikit-learn (pure NumPy + Matplotlib)
- Visualizes regression line during training
- Cost function contours with gradient descent path
