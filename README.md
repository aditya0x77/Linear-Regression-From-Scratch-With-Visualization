# ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression from Scratch (Gradient Descent + Visualizations)


This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** built from scratch with **Gradient Descent**.  
It includes detailed visualizations of how the model learns step by step.  


---

## âœ¨ Features
- Implemented without scikit-learn (pure NumPy + Matplotlib)
- Visualizes regression line during training
- Cost function contours with gradient descent path

## 1. ðŸ’¾ Data
The dataset used for training:

### The dataset is entirely synthetic, generated only for the purpose of testing the model

## 2. Data + Regression Line
Regression line fitted on the data:

## 3. Regression Line Evolution
During training, the regression line gradually aligns with the data points:

## 4. Cost Function (3D Surface)
The cost function \( J(w, b) \) visualized in 3D:
